I've made a second prototype of the Squeezebox Keyboard. It's a huge improvement over the first working prototype.

## Improvements included in this version

* Key switches are hot swappable courtesy of Kailh hot-swap sockets
  * This required a major level-up in my FreeCAD skills as there's a LOT of precise geometry
* Per-finger splay angle, adjustable for tailor fit
* Each keywell column is mechanically and electrically a separate component. Each works as a stand-alone 3-key macropad.
  * This means if one breaks or fails you only need to print a single part and handwire 3 switch/diode pairs
  * This is also extremely useful for the DIY process because each small session of handwiring work can be positively confirmed working and correct without the psychological crush of spending one or more full days wiring and soldering only to connect USB and have precisely nada happen when you press a key
* Angle between rows A and B increased to solve problem of some fingers scraping it on the fingernail side
* Smaller individual 3D printed components avoids frustration of multi-hour print job failing and delivering no usable parts
* reset button is actually mounted into a housing instead of floating in the air at the end of some wires

## Many More Details in the Blog Post

I've written up all the details in a [blog post](https://peterlyons.com/problog/2021-06-squeezebox-keyboard-v2105/) and I have posted several explanatory videos.

## I Can Haz .stl?

I've posted all the model .stl files as well as the source FreeCAD project file [on prusaprinters here](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/69209-squeezebox-keyboard-v2105). This is pretty far from being a ready-to-go DIY kit so anticipate a long struggle unless you are pretty experienced with 3D printing and handwired keyboards. If anyone actually wants to try to build one of these, I'll try to help though.

## Thanks

I continue to be very grateful for people across the Internet helping me with this project: answering questions, providing feedback and encouragement, etc. I've posted to many slacks, emails, subreddits, discords, github repos, etc to get help on this project. Especially check out [Jan Lunge's Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/ModOfLow). You'll find a link to his discord there too.
