## Schemaless - Yay?

- Short development time
- Emphasizes coding vs pre-planning schema
- **However**, comes with some risks

- No protection against developer mistakes
- Easy to end up with undocumented schema and tribal knowledge
- Easy to end up with inconsistent data


---

## Problem: Discovery

- First day on unfamiliar codebase
- What does the data look like?
- Caters to my data-driven development approach


---

## Problem: Inconsistent Data

- `User.email` started out as a string
- Requirement came down to support multiple emails
- Code changed to store new users as an array instead
- No support to follow-through with this change across all instances of the database, all areas of the codebase
