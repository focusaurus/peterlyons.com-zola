# Staff Engineer

My focus has been primarily on backend enginering building business applications and APIs. My most recent project was building the Go API services that power Mailchimp Stores ecommerce application. Mailchimp was acquired by Intuit in November 2021. My career spans 20+ years. I've helped companies of all sizes from small founding startup teams to the largest global enterprises like HP and GE.

My style and personality are thoughtful, calm, disciplined, and pragmatic. My superpower is turning chaos into order in a systematic way.

# Coding Retreats

My passion project is running [Focus Retreat Center](https://focusretreatcenter.com) with my partner. We host immersive project/learning retreats for programming, writing, illustration, and other creative pursuits.
