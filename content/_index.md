# Coding Retreats

My primary activity as of Summer 2022 is running [Focus Retreat Center](https://focusretreatcenter.com). We host immersive project/learning retreats for programming, writing, illustration, and other creative pursuits.

# Staff Engineer

My first career was primarily backend engineering building business applications. Before leaving tech to start Focus Retreat Center, I ended up working as a Staff Engineer at Mailchimp building the backend golang services that power Mailchimp Stores. Mailchimp was acquired by Intuit in November 2021.
