# Staff Engineer

My focus has been primarily on backend enginering building business applications and APIs. I'm currently a Staff Engineer at Float Health - a marketplace for home infusion nursing services. My career spans 25+ years. I've helped companies of all sizes from small founding startup teams to the largest global enterprises like HP and GE.

My style and personality are thoughtful, calm, disciplined, and pragmatic. My superpower is turning chaos into order in a systematic way.
