So when I started dealing with 1099-MISCs for tax season this year in January, I found myself struggling to get my data in a single place and compute a few simple sums for expenses, income, etc. My finances in 2013 weren't really complex enough to need a real small business finance software package, but I did find myself struggling with having to collect numbers from several different web sites to get things in order. At the end of the day I just needed to copy some numbers from web sites and total them up. However, I couldn't find any calculator out there that worked well for my use case of wanting a few key things:

* ignore extraneous formatting that may have been copy/pasted along with the numbers
* keep all the numbers on screen so I can easily see what has already been input and what has not

So, I ended up building one. Well, first I paired with [@debrazapata](https://twitter.com/debrazapata) prototyping it at a coffee shop here in Louisville. We built the whole thing in one short session and she typed everything out having no experience with AngularJS. [Here's the jsfiddle she built](http://jsfiddle.net/5QcL5/7/). My version is up here at [/plusParty](/plusParty) including clips from Clue the movie, which is a well-deserved cult classic.

So go check it out!
