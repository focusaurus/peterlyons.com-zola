There's some drama in the [expressjs](http://expressjs.com/) world today and I just wanted to express my thanks to all the contributors and supporters. ExpressJS has been involved in some capacity in probably 100% of my independent consulting projects since 2014 and the 2 full-time gigs prior to that as well. ExpressJS pays my bills!

Specifically I want to thank [Doug Wilson](https://github.com/dougwilson), [Jonathan Ong](https://github.com/jonathanong) and [TJ Holowaychuk](https://github.com/tj) for their great work on this project and the ecosystem around it.
