This morning I wrote a script to manage AWS session tokens and asked for a code review. Not optimistic that I'll ultimately use it and I'll probably go back to aws-vault, but at least it works now and I can test drive it.

I did the 3 next exercism rust exercises. There are 70+ of them and I'm worried they are too much about basic programming problems and not enough about how to write idiomatic rust, so I think starting tomorrow I'm going to just cherry pick a few that look the most interesting.

Heading to Etsy to hear Suz Hinton talk about Code as Craft this evening.
