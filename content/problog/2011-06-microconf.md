Just a quick note that I'm off to [MicroConf](http://www.microconf.com) in Las Vegas tomorrow. A buddy of mine from Denver Hack Nite is also going. It should be a really fun time and hopefully I'll learn a lot. I've been coding away like a madman (an excruciating 4-6 hours a day!) preparing a little proof-of-concept for the startup idea I'm working on. Can't wait to have it scutinized and hopefully not completely blasted to bits. I'll be blogging and [tweeting](https://twitter.com/#!/focusaurus) if there's anything interesting and I'm not too busy concentrating.
