So the week after next I start the Winter 1 2017 half-batch of [the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/). My primary project will be learning rust and systems programming. My secondary project will be some SQL modeling and reporting stuff.

Here's my plan to learn rust.

- ✓ Read [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/second-edition) Book, 2nd edition
  - ✓ Do all [exercises](https://github.com/focusaurus/rust-basics)
- ✓ Watch any interesting conference videos from the most recent Rust Conf
- ✓ Implement [the unix hexdump utility in rust](https://github.com/focusaurus/rust-basics/tree/master/hex_dump)
- ✓Listen to [The New Rustacean Podcast](http://www.newrustacean.com/)
- ✓ Listen to [The Request for Explanation Podcast](https://request-for-explanation.github.io/podcast/)
- Read and do all activities in [Rust by Example](https://rustbyexample.com/custom_types.html) 
- Do the [rustlings](https://github.com/carols10cents/rustlings) exercises
- Maybe read [Programming Rust](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/programming-rust/9781491927274/titlepage01.html)
- Maybe [build a simple blockchain in rust](https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46)
- Read [High Performance JavaScript with Rust](https://github.com/ayasin/rust-talk)
- Do some embedded work via [Discovery](https://japaric.github.io/discovery/)
- Watch the [Into Rust](http://intorust.com/) screencasts
- Do [Learning Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists](http://cglab.ca/~abeinges/blah/too-many-lists/book/)

Ultimately my final project type thing might be a crypto helper program in the spirit of [tealess](https://github.com/elastic/tealess).

Got any suggestions for me? Leave a disqus comment below or tweet me or whatever.
