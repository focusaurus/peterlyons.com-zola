As you may notice, the [peterlyons.com](/) site has been redesigned. I worked with [Stephanie Henderson](http://stephaniehenderson.com) to get a new look now that I am an independent professional. I'm pleased with the results, and the blogs are more seamlessly integrated now.

I have also released a new version of [Linkzie](https://linkzie.com) today featuring a brand new web design. The original layout of categories was based on rows and that has been changed to columns. Check it out!
