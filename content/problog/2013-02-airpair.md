So I've just been one of the earliest progragrammers to get involved with [AirPair](http://codereview.airpair.co/). It's a service that pairs entrepreneurs with technology experts for code review and pair programming sessions to help them with their coding projects.

I did some google hangouts with an entrepreneur who built his own Ruby on Rails app that analyzes geology data files for oil & gas companies and is just starting to port it over to node.js. There's a [youtube recording video of the 2-hour google hangout session this morning](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOwZvL29sSlUAj6c2i_f53A?v=gdi9xDKZ5qg) up. You can skip around in that if you want to get a feel for the service and experience.

I'm perpetually interested in the startup community in general and connecting people across geographies via the Internet, so I was excited to try it out. I've done 3 hour-long sessions so far and so far so good.
