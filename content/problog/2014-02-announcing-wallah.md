I released an open source node.js package called [wallah](https://github.com/focusaurus/wallah). I use it as a submodule in my projects and it allows my build scripts to automatically pre-install my application's dependencies (node, npm packages, python, pip packages) lazily as needed and implicitly when one of my build script commands runs.
