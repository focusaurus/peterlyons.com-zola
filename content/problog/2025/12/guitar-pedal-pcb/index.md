This fall I collaborated with my friend Brock on a guitar pedal project. It's based on a pedal schematic called "Yet Another Fuzz Face". Brock had done electronics projects but never designed and ordered a custom PCB. So I encouraged him to try inputting his schematic in KiCAD and designing a small circuit board he could mount into his guitar pedal enclosure. There was a pretty steep learning curve for KiCAD but he struggled through it and got a PCB design that looked good, was small enough to fit nicely inside the pedal, and passed the design rule checker.

So we ordered 10 prototype PCBs from [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/), which arrived in just a few days.

Here's a video of us unboxing the circuit boards. Thanks for PCBWay for sponsoring this project and getting another hobbyist maker their first custom circuit board!
