I just crossed 100,000 reputation on stackoverflow. I've posted 1618 answers. Most of this activity was around node.js and javascript, especially from when I was really focused on learning a new ecosystem between 2011 and 2014. Analytics indicate my answers have reached 6.3 million people, which I'm very pleased with.

I earned gold badges for javascript, node.js, and express. My favorite badge is "Necromancer" (answer a question more than 60 days later with a score of 5 or more), which I earned 11 times.

The past two years or so have been mostly compound interest. A lot of it is from answering really, really basic questions early enough to become a repeat hit in search queries. The answer I put the most effort into is [how to structure an express.js application](https://stackoverflow.com/a/19623507/266795).
