I built a custom desktop on a CNC router. It's a 3-layer stack of 1/2" MDF. It has recessed areas for my split keyboard and coffee mug. Cables can tunnel through the middle layer of the desk. No this is not a desktop PC, it's literally the top of a desk.

## Project Goals

* Replace my add-on forearm rests with a single desktop
* Recess my split keyboard into the desk surface for straighter wrist ergonomics
* Give my coffee a bit more of a spill-resistant setup
* route cabling within channels inside the desktop interior
  * Especially for the cable connecting the halves of the split keyboard
* learn enough CNC for this project
* Get experience building with and painting MDF

## A slow learning curve

This was my first CNC project. It took months of calendar time to come to fruition - mostly due to scheduling and tooling overhead accessing the CNCs I had access to.

Getting this project done took several months, learning a total of 4 CAD/CAM software processes across 3 operating systems, loading a full sheet of MDF into my van about 4 extra times, and juggling CNC schedules. The details are so boring that I can't even bring myself to type them out. Let's just say "hey, that looks like a great CNC project" does not articulate the requisite overhead.

## 3D-printed inserts

I used basic rounded rectangles in the actual MDF with the idea of potentially wanting different inserts over time. So I modeled up inserts for my keyboard's PCB shape using files exported from the [ergogen process I used to make my keyboard](/problog/2024/05/kipra-keyboard/). In addition to a pocket for the PCB to fit into, I needed to clear space for the cables to be connected and a hole so cables could be routed via the desktop layer 2 tunnels.

I also made a coffee holder for my favorite coffee mug. And before you point out how silly and limiting this is - don't you worry - I made an adapter so my second-favorite coffee mug fits too!
