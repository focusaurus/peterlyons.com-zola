Just a quick tip to be on the lookout for commonly-used words in technical discussions that are problematic due to being low on meaning and high on emotional weight. Watch out for:

- secure
- easy
- flexible
- lightweight, heavyweight
- virtual, physical, logical

If someone is using these and you are confused or trying to have a productive discussion, call them out and request for more specific, clearer words. Some better examples might be

- lower-latency
- longer startup time
- smaller network transfer size
- straightforward to add new endpoints in the future
- requires fewer processes
- lower annual cost
