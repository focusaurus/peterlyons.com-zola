Last night I asked RC about whether `nom` or `untrusted` seemed like better crate choices for parsing mixed text and binary file formats. This morning I woke up super early for no reason and was ready to go so I watched RC alumnus Stefanie Schirmer's talk on parser combinators.

{{ youtube(id="oU2418-8_KI") }}

Then I was excited to dig in so after I commuted in to RC early I searched on crates for "nom pem" since the PEM format was what I needed to parse next. I found an existing crate `nom_pem` that looked promising so I gave it a whirl. I was able to get it to parse a test file but I couldn't get at the parsed data. I was getting a "that field is private" error which was odd. How was I supposed to do anything with this parser if the parser output is private? So I looked again at the crate and saw "Last updated 2 hours ago". That was not the most recent update, that was the only update ever. Someone had published a nom PEM parsing crate to crates.io while I was watching the combinator video!

So I was download number 5 (probably a bunch of bots beat me to it) for that crate and the first github star. Within a few hours I had forked it and sent in 3 small PRs to fix trivial but showstopper issues, and by the afternoon they all had been merged. Go open source!

So I dove into learning `nom` which makes heavy use of macros which are hard. I spent basically all day starting with the most trivial example of like "can I tell that 'a' is the letter 'a'?" and eventually was at the point where I could parse the openssh public key format. Then I started to refactor that code into tealeaves but there's still more to do.

Today I also heard one of the RC mini-batchers talk about some cool clojure spec libraries and had a nice dinner out instead of take-out which was fun.

Today's unix command line tip is that there's a golang project by google called [der-ascii](https://github.com/google/der-ascii) that can translate both ways between the binary DER format used in some crypto stuff and an editable ascii version. Works like this:

```
grep -v - files/ssh-rsa-1024-a-private-key.pem| base64 -D | der2ascii

Pretty handy! I couldn't find it in homebrew so I had to compile it by hand and manually install it, but it works.
