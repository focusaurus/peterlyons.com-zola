**Editor's Note**

This article was originally written by Chris Potter and me when we worked at Reaction Commerce. It was published on April 15, 2020 on the Reaction Commerce Blog. Reaction Commerce was acquired by Mailchimp and the blog has disappeared, so I'm republishing here to keep the content available. I will need to reference it myself if I ever have to do graphql pagination again. To my knowledge, this is the most in-depth and technically detailed resource on the topic.

Another note is that OFFSET/LIMIT pagination MAY have severe performance problems due to full table scans to count the number of rows. So if your table has 100K rows or more you'll need to benchmark and may need an alternate implementation based on cursors.

<hr>

When building client/server applications, data sets that are too large
to reasonably transmit and process in a single request must be made
manageable via pagination. All databases and APIs typically provide a
mechanism for this. This tutorial will walk you through implementing
GraphQL pagination with PostgreSQL, but first let's explain and review
the concepts needed for SQL and pagination.

## Conceptual Overview and Glossary

The following are common terms when describing GraphQL and SQL
pagination. Some terms are taken from GraphQL pagination specifications
and supported with GraphQL connections information from Facebook. For
SQL terminology we'll use the [Postgres
definitions](https://web.archive.org/web/20210416212650/https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/queries-limit.html)
but they are relatively generic between SQL implementations.

### Offset + limit pagination terms

This is a pagination method that starts from the first record of a
sorted dataset and "pages" forward a number of offsets depending on the
limit of records requested. If there are 20 records in the result,
offset 1 with limit 5 will start from limit Ã— offset + 1 or from the 6th
record, since offsets are 0 based. The downside of offset pagination
stems from the fact it always starts from the first record in a data
set, meaning to get the last page in a result, the database query needs
to create and scan past all pages before it. This becomes less efficient
as your data size increases.

**limit** - a number that specifies the *maximum* records to be returned
in a query. If there are not enough records to fill the limit, all
records are returned.

**offset** - informs SQL how many rows to skip before returning the next
set of records.

### Cursor pagination terms

This pagination is based upon opaque identifiers which map to records
within your data set. Cursors act as a bookmark to identify positions
from which to start or end pagination. Cursors solve some efficiency
problems because they will load only the data requested, starting or
ending with the given opaque identifier.

**cursor** - a unique identifier for a record, generally an opaque
value.

*Note: A cursor is not a specific column in your database, but should be
considered a function that serves to locate a particular position in a
data set. In the most simple case your function might be cursor = field,
but this should not be an universal expectation across cursor
implementations*

**after** - GraphQL argument indicating the unique identifier we want to
start our page from and get all results after not including this
identifier.

**first** - coupled with **after**, this is the number of records to
return after the supplied cursor. If no cursor is supplied, then this
will be the number of records to return from the start of the
collection. Can also be used in GraphQL with an **offset** to implement
traditional offset pagination where **first** represents **limit**.

**before** - Complement of **after**. Indicates the unique identifer we
want to "end" our page with and get all results before, not including,
the cursor.

**last** - coupled with **before**, this is the number of records to
return before the supplied cursor. If no cursor is supplied, then this
will be the number of records to return from the end of the collection.

### PSA regarding cursor pagination

Specifications for cursor pagination assume a stable sort and direction
on a unique field from the collection. Cursor pagination assumes that
all data will be in the same direction and listed/sorted by the same
value **every time**. This might be practical for timeline based live
streams (a la Twitter or Facebook) where you can **always sort by most
recent timestamp**, but at Reaction Commerce we deal with customizable
product lists within categories, search parameters that need higher
levels of merchandising and sorting (e.g. list products from lowest to
highest price or alphebetically by name). Therefore we have introduced
two new terms which let us specify list orders discretely but add higher
orders of complexity:

**sortBy**: the pivot field from the database to sort the paginated
results by.(e.g "name" "breed" "fur-color")

**sortOrder**: the order in which to send the returned results. Options
are `ASC` or `DESC`.

*Aside: our cursor pagination will always fallback to a stable sort on a
unique field from the collection. This ensures that requested `sortBy`
fields that match (everyone named "Jane Doe") will return the same way
with subsequent requests.*

## Cursor pagination information (pageInfo)

For GraphQL pagination there is a data structure that is commonly
returned relating to the position of the returned results, defined from
Facebook's cursor connections specificaion (see further reading). This
structure is as follows

``` graphql
"pageInfo": {
    "startCursor": "<opaque-cursor>",
    "endCursor": "<opaque-cursor>",
    "hasPreviousPage": boolean,
    "hasNextPage": boolean
}
```

**startCursor** and **endCursor** simply map to the first and last items
in the collection of results returned from the query. No matter if the
results match the limit requested, we always return a `startCursor` and
`endCursor`.

### Pages are tricky

Depending on the sort order of a collection, `before` and `after` will
infer whether a returned collection `hasPreviousPage` or `hasNextPage`

### Pictures for 1000 words

Here is our cursor pagination represented by a pictoral cat collection

<figure>
  <img src="/problog/images/2020/cat-collection-forward.png"> 
  <figcaption>forward</figcaption>
</figure>


<figure>
  <img src="/problog/images/2020/cat-collection-backward.png">
  <figcaption>backward</figcaption>
</figure>

In the context of the first image we would query for the second cat, and
limit our selection to the next 5 cats after it. `hasNextPage` should
return `true` since the second to last cat exists (the next cat after
the returned collection). `hasPreviousPage` will also return true since
there is a record before the `after` cursor (pink circle)

In the context of the second image we would query for the second to last
cat, and limit our selection to the previous 5 cats before it.
`hasNextPage` should return `true` since the last cat exists, since we
exclude the queried record (green circle) from our paging information
(we already know it exists). `hasPreviousPage` will also return true
since the second cat exists (the cat before the returned collection).

*Important note from the Facebook connection specifications which is
demonstrated in the above images: the ordering of edges should be the
same when using first/after as when using last/before, all other
arguments being equal. It should not be reversed when using last/before*

# Lets get to it already

In this tutorial, we'll walk through implementing GraphQL-style
pagination on top of a PostgreSQL relational database step by step. In
this case the process of understanding the requirements, implementing
them, and verifying they are working properly is a nice encapsulated
example of the software development process and what kinds of work we as
software engineers typically do.

## A Simple Data Set

To give ourselves the best shot at implementing this quickly, and
correctly, we'll create a simple synthetic data set that is small enough
to quickly scan and also designed to surface sorting issues in an
easy-to-spot way.

Here's some SQL to create our set of test records:

``` sql
CREATE TABLE cats (id int PRIMARY KEY, name text NOT NULL);

INSERT INTO cats (id, name) VALUES
  (1, 'esther'), (2, 'cookie'), (3, 'cookie'),
  (4, 'cookie'), (5, 'dave'), (6, 'bosco'),
  (7, 'frida'), (9, 'giggles'), (10, 'jasmine'),
  (11, 'jerry'), (12, 'alice'), (13, 'iggy');
```

We can see our data with a simple query

``` sql
SELECT * FROM "cats";
 id |  name
----+---------
  1 | esther
  2 | cookie
  3 | cookie
  4 | cookie
  5 | dave
  6 | bosco
  7 | frida
  9 | giggles
 10 | jasmine
 11 | jerry
 12 | alice
 13 | iggy
(12 rows)
```

PostgreSQL is returning those results in the order they were inserted
(at least so it seems), but to ensure consistent results, we should
explicitly order by a unique column in our collection, in our case we'll
use `id`.

``` sql
SELECT * FROM "cats" ORDER BY "id" ASC;
 id |  name
----+---------
  1 | esther
  2 | cookie
  3 | cookie
  4 | cookie
  5 | dave
  6 | bosco
  7 | frida
  9 | giggles
 10 | jasmine
 11 | jerry
 12 | alice
 13 | iggy
(12 rows)
```

Also note we have some cats with the same name. This will help us ensure
correct results for some trickier cases later on.

## Case 1.1: just first

GraphQL pagination uses the inputs `first` or `last` to specify a
reduced page size. Here's the most basic paginated query just asking for
the first 3 results plus the pagination metadata fields.

**GraphQL query**

``` graphql
query {
  cats(first: 3) {
    edges {
      cursor
      node {
        id
        name
      }
    }
    totalCount
    pageInfo {
      startCursor
      endCursor
      hasPreviousPage
      hasNextPage
    }
  }
}
```

**SQL Construction**

Let's work through the fields in the graphql response and see how we can
obtain the data we need via SQL.

-   The GraphQL argument `first` is a pagination limit which is going to
    map directly to the SQL `LIMIT` clause for this query
-   `hasPreviousPage` is `false` whenever we have `first` but not
    `after` in our graphql arguments so we can determine this directly
    in code and don't need any related SQL. This is by definition the
    first page.
-   `hasNextPage` is going to be computed with our first technique which
    we'll call **beyond the limit**. We'll add 1 to the provided `first`
    parameter to "peek" ahead in the results and see if we're at the
    true end or not. Then we can determine `hasNextPage` with
    `rows returned > first`. So for this query our `LIMIT` will be `4`
    instead of `3`. **When the SQL results are returned the last record,
    if it exists, is omitted from the GraphQL response.**
    -   When results are passed, If the number of results matches the
        limit requested (4), we will know that the `hasNextPage` is
        `true` since a record exists for the start of the next page.
        This technique will be used for the extent of querying whether a
        page has another page before or after, depending on the GraphQL
        request.
-   `startCursor` is the cursor from the first row in the results
-   `endCursor` is the cursor from the last row in the results (after
    omitting the `hasNextPage` "peek" record if it's there)
-   `totalCount` requires an additional query. For convenience, we'll
    use the SQL `AS` alias to present the total_count as a column in our
    main result set. It will end up in every row, but they will all be
    identical so we'll just use the value in the first returned row.

``` sql
SELECT *,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "cats") AS "total_count"
  FROM "cats"
  ORDER BY "id" ASC
  LIMIT 4;
```

*Aside: since this tutorial is focused on pagination, we'll always do
`SELECT *` in our SQL. In a production application if a table had many
columns, you would probably specifically select only the columns
required by the graphql query.*

**SQL Results**

```
id |  name  | total_count
----+--------+-------------
  1 | esther |          12
  2 | cookie |          12
  3 | cookie |          12
  4 | cookie |          12
(4 rows)
```

**GraphQL Response**

``` json
{
  "data": {
    "cats": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "cursor": "1",
          "node": {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "esther"
          }
        },
        {
          "cursor": "2",
          "node": {
            "id": 2,
            "name": "cookie"
          }
        },
        {
          "cursor": "3",
          "node": {
            "id": 3,
            "name": "cookie"
          }
        }
      ],
      "pageInfo": {
        "endCursor": "3",
        "hasNextPage": true,
        "hasPreviousPage": false,
        "startCursor": "1"
      },
      "totalCount": 12
    }
  }
}
```

So we got 4 rows back from the database, but omitted cookie 4 from the
graphql results and got our `has*Page` booleans correct.

## Case 1.2: just last

To implement `last` isn't so easy though because SQL doesn't directly
support this. `LIMIT` always implies a limit from the beginning of the
results in SQL.  
We need to take a different approach. We have a few options

-   Make a separate query to count the number of rows and use that to
    calculate an `OFFSET`
-   Have the database reverse the sort direction of the results and use
    `LIMIT`, but then reverse the results in the application before
    sending the GraphQL response.

**GraphQL**

``` graphql
query {
  cats(last: 3) {
    edges {
      cursor
      node {
        id
        name
      }
    }
    totalCount
    pageInfo {
      startCursor
      endCursor
      hasPreviousPage
      hasNextPage
    }
  }
}
```

**SQL Option 1: Separate count query**

``` sql
-- First do a query to get the total row count
SELECT count(*) FROM "cats";
```

```
 count
-------
    12
```

``` sql
-- Compute the offset as total count minus limit
-- Then use that to send the right OFFSET
SELECT * FROM "cats" ORDER BY "id" ASC LIMIT 3 OFFSET (12 - 3);
```

```
 id | name
----+-------
 11 | jerry
 12 | alice
 13 | iggy
```

**SQL Option 2: Double Reverse**

The SQL `LIMIT` clause only works at the beginning of the result set,
not the end. But if we reverse the direction, the beginning is then the
end, right? So we can hack our way to the right results with

-   Use the reverse direction in our SQL `ORDER BY` clause
-   Use the `LIMIT` clause
-   Reverse the in-memory results in the application while building the
    graphql results

Here's how our graphql pagination metadata will be computed

-   `hasPreviousPage` will use our **beyond the limit** technique again,
    but here the results will be reversed
-   `hasNextPage` Requesting `last` without `before` is by definition
    requesting the last page of results, so we know `hasNextPage` must
    be `false` here
-   `startCursor` is the `id` from the next-to-last row in the SQL
    results
    -   This accounts both for the limit + 1 "peeking" and the
        double-reversing
-   `endCursor` is the `id` from the first row in the results
-   `totalCount` will use the same subselect/alias technique again

``` sql
SELECT *,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "cats") AS "total_count"
  FROM "cats"
  ORDER BY "id" DESC
  LIMIT 4;
```

     id |  name   | total_count
    ----+---------+-------------
     13 | iggy    |          12
     12 | alice   |          12
     11 | jerry   |          12
     10 | jasmine |          12
    (4 rows)

That gives us the correct 3 rows (13, 12, 11), plus our
`hasPreviousPage` row count peek row(10), but the rows are in the
incorrect order, so in our application code, we'd need to:

-   Check the row count to determine `hasPreviousPage`
-   discard the extra row if present
-   reverse the remaining rows for proper ordering

``` clj
; In clojure, if the sequence of database result rows is bound to "results"
; we'd do:
(reverse results)
```

``` js
// In javascript, if the database results was in the "results" array,
// we'd do
results.reverse()
```

**GraphQL Response**

``` json
{
  "data": {
    "cats": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "cursor": "11",
          "node": {
            "id": 11,
            "name": "jerry"
          }
        },
        {
          "cursor": "12",
          "node": {
            "id": 12,
            "name": "alice"
          }
        },
        {
          "cursor": "13",
          "node": {
            "id": 13,
            "name": "iggy"
          }
        }
      ],
      "pageInfo": {
        "endCursor": "13",
        "hasNextPage": false,
        "hasPreviousPage": true,
        "startCursor": "11"
      },
      "totalCount": 12
    }
  }
}
```

## Case 1.3: first + after: paging forward

OK back in the forward pagination direction via `first`, to get
subsequent pages of the query, a graphql client will send the `after`
parameter. The value of this is an opaque GraphQL `cursor` which was
provided in the `pageInfo.endCursor` field of the response for the
previous page. For clarity in this tutorial, we will return the raw ids
of the first and last records returned. In production code, we follow
Facebook's suggestion of lightly reinforcing the "opaque" nature of
cursors by base64 encoding them.

**GraphQL query**

``` graphql
query {
  cats(first: 3, after: "3") {
    edges {
      cursor
      node {
        id
        name
      }
    }
    totalCount
    pageInfo {
      startCursor
      endCursor
      hasPreviousPage
      hasNextPage
    }
  }
}
```

To make this work in SQL, we need to build a `WHERE` clause to skip the
first bit of the result set by reference, as opposed to trying to use
`OFFSET`.

Let's work through the fields in the graphql response and see how we can
obtain the data we need via SQL.

- Most things for page 2 will work the same as for page 1:  
  - `first`
  - `hasNextPage`  
  - `startCursor`
  - `endCursor`  
  - `totalCount`
- `after` is new and to make this work in SQL, we need to build a `WHERE` clause to skip the first part of the result set by reference, as opposed to trying to use `OFFSET`.
- `hasPreviousPage` we'll now have to compute. We will `COUNT(*)` the results using an inverse `WHERE` clause and alias that as `has_previous_page`. By "inverse WHERE clause" we mean use a comparison operator opposite from the one used to skip prior pages. So in this case since our main `WHERE` clause uses greater than (`>`), we'll use less than or equal to (`<`) in our `has_previous_page` subselect `WHERE` clause.
    - `(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "cats" WHERE "id" < 3) AS "has_previous_page"`
    - This query returns `3` and our application logic converts it to a boolean with just `> 0` logic.
    - This conversion to boolean could also be done directly in SQL but we declared that out of scope for this post

``` sql
SELECT *,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "cats" WHERE "id" < 3) AS "has_previous_page",
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "cats") AS "total_count"
  FROM "cats"
  WHERE "id" > 3
  ORDER BY "id" ASC
  LIMIT 4;
```

**SQL results**

```
id |  name  | has_previous_page | total_count
----+--------+-------------------+-------------
  4 | cookie |                 2 |          12
  5 | dave   |                 2 |          12
  6 | bosco  |                 2 |          12
  7 | frida  |                 2 |          12
(4 rows)
```

**GraphQL response**

``` json
{
  "data": {
    "cats": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "cursor": "4",
          "node": {
            "id": 4,
            "name": "cookie"
          }
        },
        {
          "cursor": "5",
          "node": {
            "id": 5,
            "name": "dave"
          }
        },
        {
          "cursor": "6",
          "node": {
            "id": 6,
            "name": "bosco"
          }
        }
      ],
      "pageInfo": {
        "endCursor": "6",
        "hasNextPage": true,
        "hasPreviousPage": true,
        "startCursor": "4"
      },
      "totalCount": 12
    }
  }
}
```

## Case 1.4: last + before: paging backward

Lets remember our collection in ascending `id` order:

``` sql
SELECT * FROM "cats" ORDER BY "id" ASC;

 id |  name
----+---------
  1 | esther
  2 | cookie
  3 | cookie
  4 | cookie
  5 | dave
  6 | bosco
  7 | frida
  9 | giggles
 10 | jasmine
 11 | jerry
 12 | alice
 13 | iggy
(12 rows)
```

For paging backward from the end, clients send `last` and `before` using
the value from `startCursor` in the previous query.

``` graphql
query {
  cats(last: 3, before: "13") {
    edges {
      cursor
      node {
        id
        name
      }
    }
    totalCount
    pageInfo {
      startCursor
      endCursor
      hasPreviousPage
      hasNextPage
    }
  }
}
```

To implement this, we flip our `WHERE` operator to be less than (`<`),
flip our direction to be `DESC` and then again reverse in the
application code.

``` sql
SELECT *,
  (SELECT count(*) FROM "cats" WHERE "id" > 13) as has_next_page,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "cats") AS "total_count"
  FROM "cats"
  WHERE "id" < 13
  ORDER BY "id" DESC
  LIMIT 4;
```

Notes on the SQL statement and how our graphql pagination metadata will
be computed

-   `hasPreviousPage` will use our **beyond the limit** technique again,
    but here the results will be reversed
-   `hasNextPage` here we will use the same techinque as `after` and
    `first` with a similar query
    `(SELECT count(*) FROM "cats" WHERE "id" > 13) as has_next_page,`
-   `startCursor` is the `id` from the next-to-last row in the SQL
    results
    -   This accounts both for the limit + 1 "peeking" and the
        double-reversing
-   `endCursor` is the `id` from the first row in the results
-   `totalCount` will use the same subselect/alias technique again

**SQL Result**

```
 id |  name   | has_next_page | total_count
----+---------+---------------+-------------
 12 | alice   |             0 |          12
 11 | jerry   |             0 |          12
 10 | jasmine |             0 |          12
  9 | giggles |             0 |          12
(4 rows)
```

          "cursor": "12",
          "node": {
            "id": 12,
            "name": "alice"
          }
        }
      ],
      "pageInfo": {
        "endCursor": "12",
        "hasNextPage": false,
        "hasPreviousPage": true,
        "startCursor": "10"
      },
      "totalCount": 12
    }
  }
}
```

# Part 2: Handling client-specified order

## Case 2.1: first + sortBy

When your GraphQL clients need to specify the order of results, we have
extra complexity to manage.

``` graphql
query {
  cats(first: 3, sortBy: "name", sortOrder: ascending) {
    edges {
      cursor
      node {
        id
        name
      }
    }
    totalCount
    pageInfo {
      startCursor
      endCursor
      hasPreviousPage
      hasNextPage
    }
  }
}
```

Here we need to map the GraphQL parameters to our `ORDER BY` clause
which is straightforward.

``` sql
SELECT * FROM "cats" ORDER BY "name" ASC LIMIT 3;
```

``` id
----+--------
 12 | alice
  6 | bosco
  3 | cookie
```

We can see our results are in the correct order. However, we do have 3
cats named cookie. We happened to get cookie 3 in this result, but
that's not guaranteed to always be the case. To ensure consistent
results, we should add a secondary sort.

``` sql
SELECT * FROM "cats" ORDER BY "name" ASC, "id" ASC LIMIT 3;
```

```
 id |  name
----+--------
 12 | alice
  6 | bosco
  2 | cookie
```
Here we'll always get cookie 2 in this page (assuming an unchanged data
set).

### Paging forward with ordering

Lets remember our collection in name order by both name and id for
consistency.

``` sql
SELECT * FROM "cats" ORDER BY "name" ASC, "id" ASC;
```

```
id |  name
----+---------
 12 | alice
  6 | bosco
  2 | cookie
  3 | cookie
  4 | cookie
  5 | dave
  1 | esther
  7 | frida
  9 | giggles
 13 | iggy
 10 | jasmine
 11 | jerry
(12 rows)
```

When it comes time to query the second page of these results, we need a
way to express "when sorted by name ascending, I need the results that
come after X" where X is the `endCursor` from the first page. One way to
do this is to make an extra query by the id from the cursor to get that
cat's name, and use that in our `WHERE` clause.

``` graphql
query {
  cats(first: 3, after: "2", sortBy: "name", sortOrder: ascending) {
    edges {
      cursor
      node {
        id
        name
      }
    }
    totalCount
    pageInfo {
      startCursor
      endCursor
      hasPreviousPage
      hasNextPage
    }
  }
}
```

``` sql
SELECT "name" FROM "cats" WHERE "id" = 2;
-- Now we know that cat 2 is named cookie

SELECT * FROM "cats"
  WHERE "name" >= 'cookie'
  AND "id" != 2
  ORDER BY "name" ASC, "id" ASC LIMIT 3;
```

```
id |  name
----+--------
  3 | cookie
  4 | cookie
  5 | dave
```

We need to make sure cookie 2 doesn't appear in both page 1 and page 2
of results so we explicitly filter her out by id in our `WHERE` clause.

SQL is capable of combining these 2 queries, so we take advantage of
that with a subselect.

``` sql
SELECT * FROM "cats"
  WHERE "name" >= (SELECT name FROM "cats" WHERE "id" = 2)
  AND "id" != 2
  ORDER BY "name" ASC, "id" ASC LIMIT 3;
```

```
id |  name
----+--------
  3 | cookie
  4 | cookie
  5 | dave
(3 rows)
```

Here's how our graphql pagination metadata will be computed with our
added complexity:

-   `hasNextPage` will use our **beyond the limit** technique again,
    increasing `LIMIT` from `3` to `4`
-   `hasPreviousPage` is more complicated because it introducts
    complexity with ducplicates
    -   we want to reverse the direction of the `WHERE` clause to get
        all records to `<=`
        -   we need to account for **cats with the same name but a lower
            id than `after` in the previous page** which is why `=` is
            included
    -   `after` cursor should be excluded from results with
        `AND "id" != 2"`
    -   we need to exclude all cats of the same name who's IDs are
        greater than the `after` cursor with

```` sql
 AND "id" NOT IN (SELECT "id" FROM "cats"
     WHERE "name" = (SELECT "name" FROM "cats" WHERE "id" = 2)
     AND "id" > 2))
```

for a final query that looks like:

```sql
  (SELECT * FROM "cats"
    WHERE "name" <= (SELECT name FROM "cats" WHERE "id" = 2)
    AND "id" != 2
    AND "id" NOT IN
      (SELECT "id" FROM "cats"
        WHERE "name" =
          (SELECT "name" FROM "cats"
             WHERE "id" = 2)
        AND "id" > 2));
````

```
id | name
----+-------
 6 | bosco
12 | alice
(2 rows)
```

we will return `COUNT(*)` and set this as `has_previous_page`

-   `startCursor` is the `id` from the next-to-last row in the SQL
    results
    -   This accounts both for the limit + 1 "peeking" and the
        double-reversing
-   `endCursor` is the `id` from the first row in the results
-   `totalCount` will use the same subselect/alias technique again

**Final Query**

``` sql
SELECT *,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "cats"
    WHERE "name" <= (SELECT name FROM "cats" WHERE "id" = 2)
    AND "id" != 2
    AND "id" NOT IN
      (SELECT "id" FROM "cats"
        WHERE "name" = (SELECT "name" FROM "cats" WHERE "id" = 2)
        AND "id" > 2))
    AS has_previous_page,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "cats") AS "total_count"
FROM "cats"
WHERE "name" >= (SELECT name FROM "cats" WHERE "id" = 2)
AND "id" != 2
ORDER BY "name" ASC, "id" ASC LIMIT 4;
```

**SQL Results**

``` sql
 id |  name  | has_previous_page | total_count
----+--------+-------------------+-------------
  3 | cookie |                 2 |          12
  4 | cookie |                 2 |          12
  5 | dave   |                 2 |          12
  1 | esther |                 2 |          12
(4 rows)
```

**GraphQL Response**

``` json
{
  "data": {
    "cats": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "cursor": "3",
          "node": {
            "id": 3,
            "name": "cookie"
          }
        },
        {
          "cursor": "4",
          "node": {
            "id": 4,
            "name": "cookie"
          }
        },
        {
          "cursor": "5",
          "node": {
            "id": 5,
            "name": "dave"
          }
        }
      ],
      "pageInfo": {
        "endCursor": "12",
        "hasNextPage": true,
        "hasPreviousPage": true,
        "startCursor": "10"
      },
      "totalCount": "12"
    }
  }
}
```

## Case 2.2: Paging backward with ordering: last and before

Once again a reminder:

``` sql
SELECT * FROM "cats" ORDER BY "name" ASC, "id" ASC;
```

```
id |  name
----+---------
 12 | alice
  6 | bosco
  2 | cookie
  3 | cookie
  4 | cookie
  5 | dave
  1 | esther
  7 | frida
  9 | giggles
 13 | iggy
 10 | jasmine
 11 | jerry
(12 rows)
```

To implement paging backward from the end, consider these graphql
inputs:

``` graphql
query {
  cats(last: 3, before: "13", sortBy: "name", sortOrder: ascending) {
    edges {
      cursor
      node {
        id
        name
      }
    }
    totalCount
    pageInfo {
      startCursor
      endCursor
      hasPreviousPage
      hasNextPage
    }
  }
}
```

For this we need to query for the name corresponding to our reference
id, flip the direction, and reverse in application code again.

``` sql
SELECT * FROM "cats"
  WHERE "name" <= (SELECT "name" FROM "cats" WHERE "id" = 13)
  AND "id" != 13
  ORDER BY "name" DESC LIMIT 3;
```

```
 id |  name
----+---------
  9 | giggles
  7 | frida
  1 | esther
```

We reverse that result in application code and we have the correct
results.

Here's how our graphql pagination metadata will be computed with our
added complexity:

-   `hasPreviousPage ` will use our **beyond the limit** technique
    again, increasing `LIMIT` from `3` to `4`

-   `hasNextPage` just as complicated as Case 2.1 with **query
    reversal**. The example will not have duplicate names, but we
    account for them nonetheless with one exception

    -   whereas in `after` and `first` we needed to exclude all options
        less than the supplied `id`, `before` and `last` we need to do
        the opposite so our has_next_page query becomes

``` sql
SELECT * FROM "cats"
  WHERE "name" >= (SELECT name FROM "cats" WHERE "id" = 13)
  AND "id" != 13
  AND "id" NOT IN (SELECT "id" FROM "cats"
      WHERE "name" = (SELECT "name" FROM "cats" WHERE "id" = 13)
      AND "id" < 13)
```

-   `startCursor` is the `id` from the next-to-last row in the SQL
    results
    -   This accounts both for the limit + 1 "peeking" and the
        double-reversing
-   `endCursor` is the `id` from the first row in the results
-   `totalCount` will use the same subselect/alias technique again

**Final Query**

``` sql
SELECT *,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "cats"
    WHERE "name" >= (SELECT name FROM "cats" WHERE "id" = 13)
    AND "id" != 13
    AND "id" NOT IN (SELECT "id" FROM "cats"
      WHERE "name" = (SELECT "name" FROM "cats" WHERE "id" = 13)
      AND "id" < 13))
    AS has_next_page,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "cats") AS "total_count"
FROM "cats"
WHERE "name" <= (SELECT name FROM "cats" WHERE "id" = 13)
AND "id" != 13
ORDER BY "name" DESC, "id" DESC LIMIT 4;
```

**SQL Result**

``` sql
 id |  name   | has_next_page | total_count
----+---------+---------------+-------------
  9 | giggles |             2 |          12
  7 | frida   |             2 |          12
  1 | esther  |             2 |          12
  5 | dave    |             2 |          12
(4 rows)
```

**GraphQL Result**

*Reminder: results in `edges` are reversed from SQL Result*

``` json
{
  "data": {
    "cats": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "cursor": "1",
          "node": {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "ester"
          }
        },
        {
          "cursor": "7",
          "node": {
            "id": 7,
            "name": "frida"
          }
        },
        {
          "cursor": "9",
          "node": {
            "id": 9,
            "name": "giggles"
          }
        }
      ],
      "pageInfo": {
        "endCursor": "9",
        "hasNextPage": true,
        "hasPreviousPage": true,
        "startCursor": "1"
      },
      "totalCount": "12"
    }
  }
}
```

## Case 2.3 A final example to work through

Let's work through this final challenging example

``` graphql
query {
  cats(last: 7, before: "3", sortBy: "name", sortOrder: descending) {
    edges {
      cursor
      node {
        id
        name
      }
    }
    totalCount
    pageInfo {
      startCursor
      endCursor
      hasPreviousPage
      hasNextPage
    }
  }
}
```

As a reminder, let's look at our data set sorted by name descending.

``` sql
SELECT * FROM "cats" ORDER BY "name" DESC, "id" ASC;
```

```
id |  name
----+---------
 11 | jerry
 10 | jasmine
 13 | iggy
  9 | giggles
  7 | frida
  1 | esther
  5 | dave
  2 | cookie
  3 | cookie
  4 | cookie
  6 | bosco
 12 | alice
```
Now let's understand the graphql pagination request

-   `last: 7` means the client wants only 7 results
-   `last` plus `before` means those results should be prior to the
    cursor
    -   "prior" is defined here by the client-specified ordering
    -   `before: "3"` means cookie 3 is our reference record
-   `sortBy: name` means they want them alphabetical by name
-   `sortOrder: descending` means they want them Z to A

So the correct result set looks like this

```
10 | jasmine
13 | iggy
 9 | giggles
 7 | frida
 1 | esther
 5 | dave
 2 | cookie
```

When building our SQL we need:

-   a `LIMIT 7` clause from the `last` parameter
    -   We will bump to `8` for `hasNextPage` peeking
-   an `ORDER BY name` clause but we need to flip the direction from
    `DESC` to `ASC` because of `last`
-   our final ordering by id for consistent results
    -   This is tricky because both `ASC` and `DESC` give us incorrect
        results for this case
-   a `WHERE "name"` clause based on cat 3, which requires a subselect
    to get cat 3's name
-   our `id !=` clause to manage cats with duplicate names
-   we'll also need an `id NOT IN ` subselect to properly exclude the
    cats named 'cookie' that belong to the page after this
-   The following will be handled with techniques already discussed
    -   `totalCount` (subselect and alias)
    -   `hasNextPage` (beyond the limit)
    -   `hasPreviousPage` will use an inverse where clause subselect as
        before

**SQL Query Option 1**

``` sql
SELECT *,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "cats") AS "total_count",
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "cats" WHERE "name" <
    (SELECT "name" FROM "cats" WHERE "id" = 3)) AS "has_previous_page"
  FROM "cats" WHERE
  "name" >= (SELECT "name" FROM "cats" WHERE "id" = 3)
  AND "id" != 3
  AND "id" NOT IN (SELECT "id" FROM "cats"
       WHERE "name" = (SELECT "name" FROM "cats" WHERE "id" = 3)
       AND "id" > 3)
  ORDER BY "name" ASC, "id" ASC
  LIMIT 8;
```

**SQL Results**

```
id |  name   | total_count | has_previous_page
----+---------+-------------+-------------------
  2 | cookie  |          12 |                 2
  5 | dave    |          12 |                 2
  1 | esther  |          12 |                 2
  7 | frida   |          12 |                 2
  9 | giggles |          12 |                 2
 13 | iggy    |          12 |                 2
 10 | jasmine |          12 |                 2
 11 | jerry   |          12 |                 2
(8 rows)
```

We can see the above full query repeats the subquery to find cat 3's
name twice. As an optional optimization, we could run this once and
store the result in a temporary table. Perhaps the query planner is
already smart enough to do that optimization automatically though, so
it'd be best to let benchmarks guide this choice.

**SQL Query Option 2**

``` sql
SELECT name AS pivot_name INTO pivot_cat FROM "cats" WHERE id = 3;
SELECT *,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "cats") AS "total_count",
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "cats" WHERE "name" < pivot_name)
  AS "has_previous_page"
  FROM "cats", pivot_cat WHERE
  name >= pivot_name
  AND "id" != 3
  AND "id" NOT IN (SELECT "id" FROM "cats"
                   WHERE "name" = pivot_name
                   AND "id" > 3)
  ORDER BY name ASC, "id" ASC
  LIMIT 8;
```

We get the same results as with option 1.

```
id |  name   | pivot_name | total_count | has_previous_page
----+---------+------------+-------------+-------------------
  2 | cookie  | cookie     |          12 |                 2
  5 | dave    | cookie     |          12 |                 2
  1 | esther  | cookie     |          12 |                 2
  7 | frida   | cookie     |          12 |                 2
  9 | giggles | cookie     |          12 |                 2
 13 | iggy    | cookie     |          12 |                 2
 10 | jasmine | cookie     |          12 |                 2
 11 | jerry   | cookie     |          12 |                 2

**Real Talk Time** in writing this article we found bugs in 2 separate
implementations of graphql pagination in reaction projects. This stuff
is tricky!

## Metatopic: The Process of Software Development

This blog post walks step-by-step through a process of implementing
specified behavior. It takes a methodical and use-case driven approach.
There are other approaches as well including test-driven development,
adversarial (pitting QA against development), more academically rigorous
methodologies, etc, but this is a pragmatic approach. Test data was
carefully selected to make correctness and incorrectness easier to spot
at a glance. Key in the data set was including the particular edge cases
that expose bugs in initial attempts at implementation.
