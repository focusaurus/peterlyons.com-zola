I just listened to [The Changelog Episode 201](https://changelog.com/201/) on [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) with Richard Hipp. Completely fascinating. This project is completely on outlier on so many different facets.

It is one of the most widely-used software projects of all time. It is the work of a very small team (3 engineers I believe have done the vast majority of the coding). Richard codes it in a text editor he wrote (I believe Linus Torvalds also uses a custom editor he wrote). It is tracked in a version control system called [fossil](http://www.fossil-scm.org) that Richard also wrote. SQLite has zero dependencies. Everything they need has been hand coded from scratch.

I found this interview completely spellbinding and would love to hear a follow-up. My mind just races with what Richard might say to me if he rode shotgun next to me coding for a few hours. What would he say about my tools? My methods? My domain knowledge?
