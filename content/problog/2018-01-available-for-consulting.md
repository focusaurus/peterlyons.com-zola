I have availability for new consulting engagements this year. 

Do you have an ambitious Node.js project you want to supercharge? I can get your team cruising with rock-solid practices and past all the pitfalls and stumbling blocks.

Adding Node.js and JavaScript to your tech stack? How about some expert-led training to be sure your team is fluent with the tools?

Ready to experience the game-changing effects of serverless applications? I spent most of last year immersed in AWS Lambda, Internet of Things (IoT), and event-driven architectures and would love to build a solution for you that is easy and affordable to operate.
