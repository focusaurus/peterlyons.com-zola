I believe I have now found a pair of headphones to wear while exercising and traveling that is optimal. I've gone through a lot of headphones over the years as I'm sure many of you have. I've tried both the extreme low end of the price spectrum (less than $10) and the costs-more-than-your-mp3-player range (I owned some $180 Shure E2C earbuds back when they were $180 instead of $90). Of course I have learned some lessons the hard way. The following list starts out with weightier arguments and then decays into personal preference

*   The $20 ballpark is about right where when they are inevitably lost or broken, you shake it off and move on, but they are still able to sound OK
    *   As an aside, my $180 Shure headphones started making static interference two weeks after the warranty expired.
    *   If you want a nicer pair for hi-fi listening at home, by all means go for it and invest in some nice cans, just don't bring them when traveling
*   Sound isolating earbuds are the way to go for travel and exercise. I know traditional full-ear headphones are back in popularity with the snowboarders, but in general I want something that will pack up to essentially zero size and block out the exterior noise. I don't wear these while skiing where taking them on and off frequently might be required.
*   It is better if there is a right angle between the plug and the cord. This is a sturdier design less likely to cause static or drop a stereo channel with wear and tear.
*   The combination of in-ear earbud with behind-the ear wire for stability and security is the best. You don't want your earpiece falling out and dangling there while you are working on your downward dog.
*   The cord should include a small clip you can slide up from the neck to the earbuds to zip up the "Y" section of the cable for storage to prevent tangling
*   The cord should have a woven fabric sheath instead of plastic or rubber. This makes it easier to untangle.

So to this end I think the [MEElectronics M6-BK Sport Sound-Isolating In-Ear Headphones](http://www.amazon.com/MEElectronics-M6-BK-Sport-Sound-Isolating-Headphones/dp/B0038W0K2K/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1297036394&sr=1-2) are pretty much perfect. The only item they lack from the above list is the woven fabric sheath. The behind the ear wire is minimal but effective and they come with both single and triple flange earpieces.
