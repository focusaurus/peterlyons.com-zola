I've open-sourced my mongodb/couchdb data integrity analysis tool called white glove. You can find it at [focusaurus/white-glove](https://github.com/focusaurus/white-glove) on github and [white-glove on npm](https://npmjs.com/package/white-glove). It helps with both schema discovery of a new or unfamiliar database as well as scanning your data for inconsistencies that may help you prevent problems before they cause any impact to end users.
