I propose to coin a new term: **versiona non grata**. This is to be used in software update mechanisms when a released version has severe problems and a forced update is warranted. You excommunicate that version and it becomes **versiona non grata**.

Blogging this in case I actually greated this phrase because it is great. But maybe it already exists and I just independently coined it.
