I'll be holding open office hours all day this Tuesday January 28th at the Scrib coworking space on Broadway near Spruce (basement level in office building where Unseen Bean is). I'm a full-stack web developer and veteran software developer, these days specializing in node.js and JavaScript. Come by for a code review, Q&A on node.js as a technology platform choice, pair programming, a plain-English explanation of what the heck a session cookie is, or however I can help you out. Non-technical folks - don't be shy; I think I'm pretty good at explaining technology in plain English terms and analogies.

Email me to reserve a time slot of just swing by first come, first served.
