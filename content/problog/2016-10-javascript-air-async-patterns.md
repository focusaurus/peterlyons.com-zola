I just had the pleasure of being a guest on the [JavaScript Air](https://javascriptair.com/episodes/2016-10-12/) podcast/screencast. It's episode 044 "Async Patterns in JavaScript".

[Watch the episode](https://javascriptair.com/episodes/2016-10-12/) and I hope you enjoy it! We had a great discussion and covered many aspects of asynchronous programming in JavaScript including Events, Streams, Callbacks, Promises, Generators, Coroutines, Observables/RxJS, Async/Await and more.
