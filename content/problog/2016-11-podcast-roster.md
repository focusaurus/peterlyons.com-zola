Here's a snapshot of podcasts I'm checking out these days.

- [Node Up](http://nodeup.com/) for all things node.js
- [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/) Open source in general. Great podcast.
- [The Cognicast](http://blog.cognitect.com/cognicast) From Cognitect, the company behind Clojure and Datomic. I don't do any clojure work currently but this interview-style show is always full of enlightened discussion and highly interesting.
- [JavaScript Air](https://javascriptair.com/) no longer active but lots of good episodes to review. I was a guest recently.
- [JS Jabber](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber)
- [The Freelancer's Show](https://devchat.tv/freelancers) Panel discussions on freelancing. I liked some of the earlier episodes more than the more recent stuff, but it's a good source of exposure to others' experiences freelancing
- [Soft Skills Engineering](https://softskills.audio/) only recently started listening to this but I'm hoping to learn from it
- [The Web Platform Podcast](http://thewebplatform.libsyn.com/) A bit more front-end focused so I cherry pick episodes that seem interesting
- [Software Engineering Radio](http://www.se-radio.net/)
