I got to participate in a cool new brainstorming event called [House of Genius](http://houseofgenius.org) last night. I won't say too much about it since the founders seem to prefer if the participants don't know exactly what to expect. But it was populated by a great group of smart and interesting people from many different age groups and backgrounds. It was in a super-swank enormous apartment downtown and was overall very unusual, engaging, and fun. It's funny, last week's Denver Hack Nite meetup was also in an inappropriately-fancy mansion. Maybe all my tech meetups will gradually start shifting from coffee shops and garages to luxury homes with helipads....
