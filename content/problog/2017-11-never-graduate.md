**Neo**: Whoa. Déjà vu. Déjà vu.

**Trinity**: What did you see, Neo?

**Neo**: It felt like I just did three Code and Coffees back to back.

**Morpheus**: Code and Coffee is a system. A system with rules. Rules like "Code and Coffee is once a week". Rules like "Code and Coffee is nine to noon".
Some of these rules can be bent. Others can be broken.
What if I told you that you could do sixty Code and Coffees in a row?

**Neo**: That's impossible.

**Morpheus**: Is that what you believe? What if I told you some people do one hundred and eighty Code and Coffees back to back? Impossible? Free your mind. Never graduate.


(*Morpheus slow-mo backflips over a desk, reaches  overhead to start typing on a laptop while still upside down before landing into a swivel chair*)
